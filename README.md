## Example TODO app for HCL (NodeJS and Angular)

### This example was written in 4 hours (excluding initial setup).
### Keep in mind, that there are many features lacking (e.g. DB is mocked, no async code used, no general error handler for express, no tests, etc) and I do realize that this is not a perfect implementation.

### Also, please mind that I'm more into functional programming paradigm rather than pure OOP (still studying FP and switching slowly).
